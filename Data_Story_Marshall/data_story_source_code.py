Some random stranger insists that the track you're vibing to is definitely Techno, but you know it‚Äôs House. Or is it? Panic sets in. What if your listening history isn't impressive enough to back up your claim? What if you're about to get ratioed into oblivion?""")

EDM is a vast, wonderfully chaotic world where genres blend, mutate, and sometimes defy definition altogether.

# **Chosen of Dataset

st.title("Dataset Source Explanation")
st.write("For this project, we are using the EDM Music Genres Dataset from Kaggle, originally uploaded by Sivadithiyan (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sivadithiyan/edm-music-genres). This dataset is sourced from YouTube music mixes and contains 16 different electronic music genres (such as Techno, House, Trance, etc.). Each genre is represented by 2,500 three-second audio clips, evenly split into 2,000 for training and 500 for testing. The dataset was processed using Ableton, extracting spectral features, MFCCs, Chroma, Tonnetz, and other audio characteristics for music classification, genre analysis, and machine learning applications.")
st.write(" However, because the full dataset is very large, using it directly might lead to performance issues (or, in extreme cases, turn your CPU into an expensive toaster). To make the program run smoothly on most machines, we use a smaller dataset that randomly selected 10% subset of the training data.")
st.caption("If you have a powerful computer (and don‚Äôt mind your fans sounding like a jet engine), you can swap out train_sample.csv for the original train_data_final.csv in the code. The program is designed to handle this switch seamlessly.")
# **Genre Distribution**

df = pd.read_csv("train_sample.csv")
fig = px.bar(df["label"].value_counts(), labels={'index': 'Genre', 'value': 'Count'}, title="Genre Count")
st.plotly_chart(fig)

st.caption("What are those? To me, these are just a bunch of bars that look almost the same height.")
st.write("Here, we have a bar chart showdown of EDM genres, where each genre is flexing its musical muscles to prove who dominates the dataset! Think of it like a popularity contest at a massive festival‚Äîexcept instead of fans, we‚Äôre counting tracks.Looking at the chart, it‚Äôs clear that no single genre is stealing the spotlight‚Äîmost genres have roughly the same number of tracks. This means we‚Äôve got a balanced dataset, so every genre gets a fair shot at being analyzed.")
st.caption("Sounds interesting. But what if some of them is much taller than others?")
st.write("If one genre had way more tracks than the others, our analysis might be biased, like having a DJ that only plays House music all night (that would be so boring). Since the dataset is evenly spread, our machine learning models can learn fairly from all genres‚Äîno favoritism here! If your favorite genre is at the bottom of the chart, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit‚Äôs about quality, not quantity.")
st.caption("Well, as an Ambient fan I'm glad to hear this.")
st.write("What‚Äôs Next? Now that we know how our dataset is structured, let‚Äôs dig deeper‚Äîwhat makes these genres sound different?")


# **Feature Analysis**

st.header("üìä Spectral Features by Genre")
st.write("If EDM were a high-tech cooking show, then spectral features would be the ingredients that define the flavor of each genre. Some genres love spicy high frequencies (like Techno), while others prefer smooth and creamy bass (like Lofi). Just like a chef carefully selects ingredients, producers tweak these spectral properties to craft the perfect sonic experience.")

st.write("Each genre has its signature sound. For example:")
st.write("House & Techno has higher spectral centroid which determines brightness (like how much spice in a dish).")
st.write("Lofi & Ambient has lower rolloff which indicates energy in low frequencies (like adding extra butter for richness).")
st.write("Dubstep & Drum & Bass has wider spectral bandwidth which measures spread of frequencies (like how complex the flavors are).")



selected_feature = st.selectbox("Select a feature to compare:", df.columns[:-2])
fig = px.box(df, x="label", y=selected_feature, title=f"{selected_feature} by Genre")
st.plotly_chart(fig)

st.caption("I'm only seeing a bunch of boxes, please explain")
st.write("Think of this box plot as a musical talent show‚Äîeach genre steps onto the stage, showing off how its spectral feature varies. Some genres are consistent performers, while others have wildly experimental tracks that don‚Äôt fit the norm.")
("Here's how to read the stage performance:")
("""The box represents the middle 50% of values‚Äîthis is where most tracks in a genre hang out. The line inside the box is the median‚Äîthe "average performer" for that genre. The whiskers show the full range of normal values‚Äîstretching their arms out to show flexibility. Dots outside the whiskers? These are the rebels‚Äîtracks that push genre boundaries and break expectations!""")
("Taking Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE) as an example, it measures the loudness fluctuations within a track. A higher RMSE generally indicates a track with punchy, dynamic energy, while a lower RMSE suggests a softer, more consistent sound. If we click on the bar and take a closer look at the selected spectral feature rmse_mean and see how different genres perform, we can find out that Phonk is like that contestant who can do everything from opera to rap‚Äîit has a huge range of values, meaning tracks in this genre vary a lot in spectral characteristics. Lofi & Psytrance are the disciplined ones‚Äîtheir values are tightly packed, meaning these genres have a consistent sound that artists stick to. Dubstep & Ambient have some rule-breakers‚Äîthose outliers could be experimental tracks or hybrids that mix with other genres.")
("Due to space limitations, we can't walk you through every selectable feature from the dataset, but feel free to explore them all on your own!")


st.caption("So, what's the conclusion? Do we get anything that the data didn't explicitly tell us?")
st.write("The most important conclusion is: genres are not mololithic."
""" Even within a single genre, spectral properties vary widely, and some tracks blur the boundaries between styles."""
""" If you were a producer and you want to make your track "more techno", you can tweak spectral centriod, MFCCs and RMSE to match the genre's signature.""")
st.write("Now that we've learned individual features, what about putting them together? Can we cluster genres based on their spectral properties? Let's move on to find the answer.")

"This is where dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE come in.")

st.caption("But why clustering?")
st.write("Different from other music genres, EDM genres are highly overlap and blend (e.g. Tech House is a mix of Techno and House). By applying PCA, UMAP and t-SNE, we can see: 1. Which genres are naturally grouped together. 2. Which genres are distinct and separate. 3. Which genres have significant overlap, indicating subgenres.")

# **Conclusion**
st.header("In All Words...What Did We Learn?")
st.write("""
EDM has never been about fitting into neat little boxes‚Äîit thrives on evolution, fusion, and defiance of strict classification.
Throughout this data-driven journey, we‚Äôve uncovered the hidden patterns in sound, from spectral fingerprints that give each genre its unique identity to machine learning models that try (and sometimes hilariously fail) to categorize music into rigid labels. But in the end, what we‚Äôve really revealed is the illusion of fixed genres.
Genres in EDM are more like guidelines than rules‚Äîoverlapping, borrowing, and constantly reshaping themselves. What sounds like House today might be labeled Future Garage tomorrow, and what was once dismissed as "just noise" could define the next big movement. Producers can use spectral insights to refine their sound, nudging their tracks toward a particular vibe‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt mean the music itself follows the rules. Listeners, too, can explore EDM beyond labels, discovering that their favorite "Techno" track might have more in common with Psytrance than they thought.
But perhaps the most important takeaway is that music will always resist being neatly categorized. Just like the imposters in our visualizations, innovation thrives in the unexpected‚Äîthose tracks that blur genres, challenge norms, and redefine what EDM can be.
